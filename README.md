# kariakoo market
 It is the busiest and the biggest market that contributes substantially to Dar es Salaam's food provision as well as a small-scale economy. Until recently Kariakoo was also one of the main dala dala "stations" in Dar es Salaam, although this has now been moved to south east of Mawasiliano as the Mawasiliano bus terminal.
